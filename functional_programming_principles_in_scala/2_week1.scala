// Programming Paradigms
1) imperative programming
   variables assignments, control structures (if-else branch, loops, etc.)
2) functional programming (declaritive)
   no mutations, operators/functions
   in a restricted sense: no mutable variables, assignments, control structures
     ex. Haskell without I/O Monad or UnsafePerformIO
   in a wider sense     : contruct programs using functions
     ex. Haskell in full , or Scala
     functions are first-class citizens, i.e. they can be passed as parameters or as returned results
     there are a set of operators to compose functions
   pros:
     simple reasoning principles, i.e. good modularity
     good for parallelism, i.e. for multicores (ex. akka) and for distributed systems (ex. spark)
(orthogonal to OOP, both of the above two can be combined with OOP)
3) object-oriented programming
